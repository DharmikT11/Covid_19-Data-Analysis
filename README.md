## 🧹 What I Did (Project Steps)

1. **Data Collection:**  
   Downloaded COVID-19 related datasets from trusted sources.

2. **Data Cleaning:**  
   - Removed null and duplicate values  
   - Standardized column names  
   - Handled missing data  
   - Converted date formats for time-series analysis

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Analyzed total confirmed, recovered, and death cases  
   - Identified top affected countries  
   - Calculated mortality and recovery rates  
   - Examined country-wise and global trends

4. **Insights and Observations:**  
   - Recovery rate was higher in countries with early containment  
   - Some countries had underreporting due to limited testing  
   - Countries with strong healthcare systems had lower death rates

## 📌 Sample Insights

- 🟢 **Top 5 Countries with Highest Confirmed Cases**
- 🔴 **Countries with Highest Mortality Rates**
- 📈 **Daily Growth Trends Over Time**
- 🧠 **Correlation between Testing and Confirmed Cases**
